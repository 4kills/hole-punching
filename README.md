# Hole Punching

Hole punching is the technique of establishing connections between computers
from different local networks over the Internet. For further reading on hole punching see [Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_punching_(networking))

The goal of this project is to provide libraries for implementing peer-to-peer clients and the rendezvous server in several languages.
These libraries will perform the hole punching and establish the connections.
After that you may do as you please with these connections.

Feel free to navigate to the respective language directories for more information 
as well as to the [docs](./docs) for an overview and the [basic concepts of hole punching](./docs/README.md).
